I am a mom of two boys, and the past 6 years I have been mostly dedicated to them, that time made me think about what would be worth to do to not stay at home taking care of the children.
After a reading and researching about Software developing, which was an area I had never thought about as an option for me (grew up in Chile) I realized that it was my carrer. 
I moved to Seattle and found Ada, and I thank every day for what I am doing. At the time I am excited to start learning how does coding work in the real world, to learn about other peoples experience and different techniques so then I have the opportunity to be the one who can give to the industry.
Programming for me is fun, and challenging and makes me want to work every day!. It is a problem solving life, which is what I have always loved to do. 
I am open to learn anything/everything. I feel that I need to learn more to know what technologies or skills I am more interested .
